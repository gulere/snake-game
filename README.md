# Game tinkering #2 | Retro Snake Game

I've created a simple snake game inspired by the YouTube tutorial 'How To Code The Snake Game In Javascript' by How to Become a Developer. 
However, I have made several modifications to personalize it. For example, I have added sound effects for when the snake eats the target and when collisions occur, as well as when the player presses the spacebar. 
Additionally, I have implemented a pause function to enhance gameplay. 
While I have maintained the overall design in CSS, I have made minor alterations like changing the target to a ball shape and adding a text display for when the game is paused.
Finally, I incorporated the original Snake game logo, which I found online.

For future upgrades, I plan to also incorporate a "Game Over Screen", temporary powerups, multiple levels, and other enhancements to further improve the user experience.
